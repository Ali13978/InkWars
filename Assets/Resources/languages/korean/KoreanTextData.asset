    comment: "4 x Guinness World Record Holder, 4 x World Champion and 2 x EVO
    Champion; Ryan Joseph Hart, specialises in 2D and 3D fighting games
    based on intense hand-eye coordination, psychological manipulation
    and creative expression. Ryan is the most victorious fighting game
    player to ever come from the European continent and has the longest
    reign of championship success, spreading across 15 years - from 1994
    - 2009 where he won competitions on multiple game franchises simultaneously.
    Despite less success, from 2010 - 2015, Ryan still won various 2D
    and 3D gaming tournaments both nationally and internationally. During
    this 20+ year period, Ryan won tournaments on multiple games simultaneously,
    and successfully travelled to win events in Europe, Asia, Australia,
    North America and South America. No fighting game player has won
    more tournaments in more countries around the world."

    gaming since 1992. Studying business in Kansas USA, he has since
    gone on to attempt to take eSports to the next level. Being a hardcore
    gamer himself, challenges are no obstacle.Taking his skills to Octopia,
    he has since gone on to become an Ink Wars King! Be weary of battle
    with Tako Benny as he will not take losing lightly."
